Purpose
-
thinaer-react-components serves as a repository for all of our reusable react components.
They are free to download and use. Usage documentation for each component is located in a header in each file.

For the time being, you will want to import this git project as a submodule in your app. Once it has matured some,
I will set it up as an npm package.

Requirements
-
* request-promise-native
* lodash
* react-select
* recharts (https://github.com/recharts/recharts)
* react-pager (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-pager)
